# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove any remaining “Instamart”/“InstaMart” wording and ensure the app consistently displays “MyLocal Kart” branding across the entire frontend.

**Planned changes:**
- Audit all user-facing frontend copy and replace any occurrences of “Instamart”/“InstaMart” with “MyLocal Kart” (including headings, buttons, helper text, empty states, dialogs, toasts, etc.).
- Update user-visible metadata (e.g., HTML document title) to use “MyLocal Kart”.
- Update user-facing accessibility text (alt text, aria-labels, and similar labels) to ensure it uses “MyLocal Kart” and never “Instamart”/“InstaMart”.

**User-visible outcome:** Users navigating the app as any role only see “MyLocal Kart” in the UI, titles/metadata, and accessible labels, with no “Instamart”/“InstaMart” appearing anywhere.
