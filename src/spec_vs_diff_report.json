  "summary": "The diff updates branding text in `ProfileSetupModal.tsx` to “MyLocal Kart”, but there is not enough evidence that the entire frontend was audited and fully purged of all “Instamart”/“InstaMart” occurrences (including document title/metadata and accessibility labels) as required by REQ-13.",

      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Audit the entire frontend for any remaining user-facing occurrences of “Instamart”/“InstaMart” (including headings, buttons, helper text, empty states, dialogs, alt/aria labels, metadata/document title, and any displayed copy) and replace them with “MyLocal Kart” everywhere.",
      "reason": "Only one frontend component (`ProfileSetupModal.tsx`) is shown as modified with “MyLocal Kart” text. The diff does not show changes to other UI surfaces or to HTML document title/metadata and accessibility labels across the app, so the required comprehensive audit/replacement is not evidenced.",
